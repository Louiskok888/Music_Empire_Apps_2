## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges

One of the most significant challenges we faced was getting familiar with all the technologies involved in creating the app. Although we had some prior experience with each of the technologies, using them together to build a full-stack app required us to learn how they integrate and work together. This meant that we had to spend a lot of time researching, testing, and troubleshooting to ensure that all the components of the app worked seamlessly together.

Another technical challenge we faced was deploying the app on a cloud platform such as MongoDB Atlas Database, Amazon Web Services and Vercel Platform. This required us to learn about cloud technologies such as serverless architecture, load balancing, and security. We also had to ensure that the app was scalable and could handle a large number of users.

### Teamwork Challenges

Working in a team of three also presented some challenges. One of the most significant challenges we faced was communication and collaboration. We had to establish clear communication channels and agree on project milestones and deadlines to ensure that everyone was working towards the same goals. We also had to delegate tasks efficiently and ensure that everyone was contributing equally. Apart from that, we faced the challenge of integrating our individual tasks and resolving numerous errors that surfaced during the development process. Hence, we had to work together efficiently to debug our code to achieve our project's ultimate goal.

### Conclusion
Creating and deploying a MERN app is a challenging task that requires extensive knowledge and expertise in each of the technologies involved. Additionally, working in a team can present its own set of challenges, including communication, collaboration, and conflict management. However, despite these challenges, working on the app was a great learning opportunity that helped us develop valuable skills and experience in full-stack development and teamwork.
